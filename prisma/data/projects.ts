                introduction: `I made several attempts to create this project. The initial idea for it emerged in the *first half of 2021*. Unfortunately, at that time, I lacked the knowledge in the field of UX and UI, and thereby I couldn't come up with a visually appealing design. Subsequently, I had a flurry of different responsibilities that took precedence, causing coding to take a back seat for a while. However, during my journey to save money for university in Norway after graduating from high school *in 2022*, I gathered enough energy to create the entire visual layout of the project using Figma, and then efficiently transformed it into a Next.js app.`,
                purpose: `The clear purpose of this app was to *showcase my coding skills*, provide an introduction that highlights my previous experiences and current sources of motivation, and outline my plans for the near future. I also dedicated specific sections to list a few of my favorite leisure activities and schools I attended.`,
                conclusion: `My portfolio has far exceeded my most ambitious and optimistic expectations, and I'm immensely proud of its final outcome. This project serves as a detailed account of my evolution as a software craftsman, showcasing the decisions I've made, the problems I've solved, and the sacrifices I've made during this period.

Due to the numerous responsibilities associated with *impending final exams*, this project took significantly more time than expected. Nonetheless, I'm rather proud of its final state, but I still see room for further improvements. The project's visual design has been entirely revamped, including everything from the color palette and fonts to content placement, and I even changed the tech stack twice. I always strive to do my best and put a significant amount of effort into ensuring the quality meets my standards.`,
                purpose: `The primary concept of this application is to enable users to *add various travel destinations* and then highlight places worth visiting, such as restaurants, museums, art galleries, and more. Additionally, the application features a highly effective review system for both destinations and landmarks, allowing users to *share their experiences* with the site's content. Each review includes a score from 0-10, a description, and relevant aspects of the subject being reviewed. Other users can then *rate your review* by giving it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.`,

            shortDescription: `It was quite a spontaneous and haphazard project; I hadn't prepared any plan for it. However, the primary goal was to *learn the basics of Node.js* as well as some *fundamental database concepts*.`,

                introduction: `I managed to build this app in just a few days. The idea of using games as the primary theme for the app was inspired by the upcoming release of Cyberpunk 2077, which I was very excited about at the time. Despite the app's appearance not meeting my standards, I paid a lot of attention to making it look as good as possible. As a result, the website is *fully responsive*.`,
                purpose: `The primary purpose of this application is quite evident, with its focus on games. However, another notable feature of this app is the *review system*, which includes *likes and dislikes*. The app also includes *pagination*. In hindsight, I believe that implementing websockets would have been a valuable addition to enhance the user experience.`,
                conclusion: `After completing this app, I felt more confident than ever in concepts like *seeders*, *migrations*, and, most importantly, the significance of ORM's. I also gained insights into some limitations and efficient approaches to writing Vue.js, as well as combining it with styles.`,

            shortDescription: `My very *first commercial project ever*. I worked with a pre-made application design from another company, and my responsibilities included, among other tasks, developing a custom CRUD system for managing their blog posts and current offers.`,
            description: {
                introduction: `*Important Note:* The current website was not created by me; my version replaced it after two years of use. The project was intended to be an application *for a charity organization in my hometown*, whose founder was the aunt of my best friend at the time. That's how we began working together. I was asked to create a landing page and several other subpages based on the design concept provided by their graphic team.`,
                purpose: `The purpose of the app was to provide a website where potential customers could find information about the charity, its services, and its founders.`,
                conclusion: `The project itself was a valuable lesson for me in dealing with other people and building trust. Looking back, I consider this project to have been quite challenging and somewhat disappointing. However, it was my first significant commercial project, and I am thankful for the opportunity to test myself in a real job context. Despite the difficulties, I'm ultimately satisfied with the outcome.`,
